## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found a security issue, report us by:
* [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/e-hakson/Hospital-Management-System/security) Section

Once the report will be handled, and if the issue is not yet fixed (or in progress) we'll add it to the GitHub security tab, and add you as observer. Meanwhile, you will reserve a CVE for the issue.

Thank you for improving the security of HMS.
